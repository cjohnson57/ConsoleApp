# ConsoleApp

An entityframework practice program. Connected to a database on my computer so you probably can't use it if you download it.

It's not actually a console app, it just started as one but over time it became a Windows Forms app.

The stuff I wrote is in C#, but the entityframework Powershell scripts are so long GitHub considers it a Powershell program.

Connects to a database of countries and prints a list of them. 

You can edit a country's properties, delete a country, or add a new country.

You can also find a particular country so you don't have to scroll through the entire list.

For fun I added the ability to add a random country with an attempt at realistic values (besides name which is just a random string,
although then the 3-letter country code is based on that random string.)

A sample of some countries generated by the random button:
